# Privilege-Interfaces-InnerClasses-CS112-Lab06
Lab #6 - Privilege + Interfaces
Racism, sexism, ableism, xenophobia, and so many other systems of oppression create environments where it's difficult to have conversations challenging them. A common thread in those discussion is the recognition of one's privilege. From this week's prep, you saw the Privilege Walk activity and how powerful it can be with a group of people.

Although we can't measure the exact privilege an individual has, we can do our best to provide an estimate based off of some statements/questions similar to the Privilege Walk activity. Based off a users answers, the provided program adds/subtracts points to calculate a person's privilege estimate.

Most of the program is complete, but you're asked to complete the project by:

adding the Comparable interface implementation to the Person class, allowing you to also upgrade the driver in Main to display a summary of how the users privilege estimate compares to the other 4 preloaded users information (see Compare with others option screenshot below for an example of what this could look like).
adding the Identity inner class to the Person class, which contains pronouns and background instance variables of type String. The story instance variable in the outer class Person should be changed from String to Identity to use the upgrade.
TODO: comments have been placed where appropriate for the above 2 parts, however the changes required to get everything work will extend beyond the TODO: markers. For example, changing the story instance variable will change the setters, getters, and constructors. It is also suggested (see UML below) that you create individual setters for the Identity instance variables. Full details on what is required for each part of the lab follow after the UML diagram.

UML Diagram below shows what the final structure should look like after the changes above:

List of Requirements:
Part 1 : Implementing Comparable
Person.java:
Upgrade class so it implements Comparable interface to compare to another Person object based on the natural ordering of people for this project, based on their privilege estimate
Main.java:
Complete option 3 (compare to others) to compare the users info to the all of the others in the provided array
Make sure you use the compareTo method for the comparison!
Part 2 : Upgrading to Identity Inner class
Person.java:
Add the Identity inner class as designed in the UML diagram above
Change the story instance variable to Identity type
Make sure to update all the methods in Person to reflect the change, see UML diagram above for guidance
Methods, like equals, will also need changes within their method bodies. Make sure to go through each method that uses story and change appropriately
Main.java:
Update the fillInfo method to take in the additional Identity data needed
Provide examples of preferred pronouns for the user (see sample screenshots below)
Make sure to call the new setter methods in Person
Sample Working Screenshots:
Note that your output may differ from the examples shown below, as long as it fulfills the requirements above and the output is clean you have creative liberty on how you provide feedback to the user.

Hacker Challenge
Remember the Privilege Walk video/activity? Try to simulate that visual, it may not capture the experience of doing the activity in person but we can try to visualize the final results at least! Here's an example of what that could look like:

Another challenge? You got it! Take a look at the axis of privilege diagram (top of this README file) and add more questions to get plenty of coverage for every line in the diagram. Be thoughtful with your wording so it fits the Yes/No format of answering the questions. The Privilege Walk video may come in handy here!

Want one last challenge? Phew you're on a roll! Add more values to Identity (i.e., gender expression, race/ethnicity, nationality, sexuality, etc.). Be thoughtful and intentional in the data collected, as well as how you ask for it. There should be ways to opt out of certain questions if a user doesn't feel comfortable answering certain questions.
